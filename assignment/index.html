    <p>// STRETCH GOALS:

      // 16 - Make a variable called `mostPets` and a conditional that
      // correctly checks the `pets` and `friendsPets` variables, and
      // assigns the highest value to `mostPets`. There's several possibilities --
      // be sure to think through all the scenarios. 
      // console.log `mostPets` after the conditional has run.
      mostPets=(pets>friendsPets);
      
      if (mostPets) {
          console.log(mostPets);
      }
        <strong>Not entirely confident about this one </strong>
